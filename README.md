# The Best Todo App

Why this is the best among so many of them?

Well, it is implemented in Java 17 with the minimal use of external libraries (no frameworks!).

Code has close to 100% test coverage (including http and persistence layer).

Everything is in the code, there are no annotations and other frameworks magic.

Just simple, understandable, working and fully tested code.

Tech used:

* [Javalin](https://javalin.io) - library for writing http servers
* [JOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/) - library for writing SQL
* [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) - library for testing things in Docker
* Postgresql for persistence
* Docker as a runtime/deployment
